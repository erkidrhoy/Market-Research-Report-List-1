<p><strong>The Iron Chelation Therapy Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transfusional Iron Overload</li><li>NTDT Caused Iron Overload</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The iron chelation therapy market addresses conditions such as transfusion-related iron overload and NTDT (non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia) caused iron overload. In transfusion-dependent patients, repeated blood transfusions lead to excessive iron accumulation, necessitating chelation to prevent organ damage. Similarly, individuals with NTDT experience iron overload due to ineffective erythropoiesis, making chelation therapy essential for managing their condition. These therapies help mitigate the risks associated with iron toxicity, promoting better health outcomes for affected patients across various demographics.</p></p>
